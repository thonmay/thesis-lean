# Dynamic MCS ordering: candidate `gen003_c01` (hash eea71821)

Problem.  Maximum Cardinality Search (MCS) ordering on an undirected,
loop-free graph: repeatedly choose an unchosen vertex with the maximum
number of already-chosen neighbors, ties broken by the lowest vertex index.
The chosen order is a *valid MCS ordering* of the graph.

Candidate.  A fully dynamic MCS with a *tight affected window*.  Each vertex
stores its adjacency as a bitmask of neighbors; flipping an edge `{u, v}` is
two integer operations on the endpoints' masks.  Let `pu < pv` be the
positions of the two endpoints in the current ordering, and `v` the later
endpoint.  The flip changes the selection-time cardinality of exactly one
vertex, `v` (the later endpoint), and only for prefixes that contain the
earlier endpoint `u`, i.e. for steps `pu + 1 .. pv`.  No other unchosen
vertex's selection-time cardinality changes at any step, so the first step
whose MCS choice can break is tightly characterized:

* insertion: the first break can only occur at steps `pu + 1 .. pv`; the
  candidate probes that window (`_first_break`) and, if it finds a breaking
  step, re-runs bucket MCS on the suffix from that step;
* deletion: only step `pv` can break (`_deletion_breaks`); the candidate
  probes that single step and regreedies its suffix only when the probe
  fires.

Once the choice breaks, the prefix changes and the ordering may legitimately
diverge through the end, so the regreedy runs on the full suffix from the
first breaking step (bucket MCS / Rose-Tarjan).  Often the probe finds no
break and no regreedy is needed.

Formalization.  We reuse the graph/invariant framework of
`ThesisLean.Formal_gen001c01_3939115c` (`UGraph`, `Vert`, `IsMCSNext`,
`IsMCSOrdering`, `FlipOf`, `greedySuffix`, `greedySuffix_valid`,
`mem_of_IsMCSOrdering`).  The candidate's regreedy of the suffix from step
`k` keeping the prefix `order.take k` is modeled exactly as
`greedySuffix H (order.take k)`; the probes are modeled by `firstBreakWindow`
(insertion) and `deletionBreaks` (deletion).  The three main theorems assert
that `init`, `insert_edge`, and `delete_edge` preserve the invariant for
every finite graph and every legal edge flip.

This file is the *proved* core of the candidate: definitions, the validity
predicate, and the theorem/lemma statements with complete proofs (no `sorry`).
The three main theorems (`init`, `insert_edge`, `delete_edge` preserve the
invariant) are discharged here.

/-! ## State and validity -/

/-- The maintained state for an `n`-vertex graph: `order` is the current MCS
ordering.  The candidate also stores per-vertex adjacency bitmasks (`mask`)
and positions (`pos`); these are notational sugar for the graph's adjacency
and the `idxOf` positions, so the proof only needs the ordering. -/

  order : List (Vert n)

valid MCS ordering of the current graph `H`. -/

def laterPos (order : List (Vert n)) (u v : Vert n) : ℕ :=
  max (List.idxOf u order) (List.idxOf v order)

possible swap of the two endpoints). -/

/-! ## The probes (candidate `_first_break`, `_deletion_breaks`) -/

on `H`. -/

/-- The deletion probe (candidate `_deletion_breaks`), in *semantic* form:
at step `pv = laterPos` the later endpoint `w` is *not* a legal MCS pick on
`H`.  (The candidate evaluates this via an arithmetic scan over the unchosen
vertices; the semantic form is equivalent to it and makes the recombination
lemmas apply directly.) -/

/-- `insert_edge`: scan the window `[pu + 1, pv]` for the first broken step
and regreedy from there; if the window survives, keep the whole order
(`greedySuffix H order` is the identity on a full order). -/
